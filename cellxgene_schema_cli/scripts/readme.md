# Updating reference files

## Quick start 
To update the gene references, update `cellxgene_schema_cli/cellxgene_schema/gencode_files/gene_info.yml` with new references.

To update ontologies, update the `cellxgene-ontology-guide` version in `cellxgene_schema_cli/requirements.txt`.

- Then the following command will download and process the gene references and update the respective package files under `cellxgene_schema_cli/cellxgene_schema/gencode_files/`

```bash
make update-gene-references
```

The gene reference files are used internally by the class `cellxgene-schema.ontology.GeneChecker`

## Updating ontologies

Ontology information for cellxgene-schema is derived from `cellxgene-ontology-guide`. To update the ontologies in 
conjunction with a schema release, update [ontology_info.json in cellxgene-ontology-guide](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/cellxgene-ontology-guide/blob/main/ontology-assets/ontology_info.json),
and then generate a new release with the subsequently generated ontology files. Bump the version of `cellxgene-ontology-guide` in 
`cellxgene_schema_cli/requirements.txt` to this latest release.

## Updating gene references

Gene references are stored under  `cellxgene_schema_cli/cellxgene_schema/gencode_files/`

The following gene references are currently stored (to see specific versions refer to schema definition):

1. Human `genes_homo_sapines.csv.gz`
2. Mouse `genes_mus_musculus_sapines.csv.gz`
3. sars‑CoV‑2 `genes_sars_cov_2.csv.gz`
4. ERCC Spike-Ins `genes_ercc.csv.gz`

To update these gene references, a developer has to do run the following:

```bash
make update-gene-references
```

This will:

1. Download the gene reference files.
2. For 10X data: decompress it, get the GTF files and remove the rest.
3. At the end the following files will be in the folder:

    - `mus_musculus.gtf.gz`
    - `homo_sapiens.gtf.gz`
    - `sars_cov_2.gtf.gz`
    - `ercc.txt`

The GTF files for mouse and human are obtained from the 10X reference data. The GTF file for sars‑CoV‑2 is obtained from ENSEMBL. The ERCC IDs are obtained from ThermoFisher.
