# Schema

Contact: brianraymor@chanzuckerberg.com

Document Status: _Draft_

Version: 5.3.0

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED" "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [BCP 14](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp14), [RFC2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt), and [RFC8174](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8174.txt) when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

## Schema versioning

The CELLxGENE schema version is based on [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

**Major version** is incremented when schema updates are incompatible with the AnnData and Seurat data encodings or CELLxGENE API(s). Examples include:
  * Renaming metadata fields
  * Deprecating metadata fields
  * Changing the type or format of a metadata field
 
**Minor version** is incremented when schema updates may require changes only to the `cellxgene-schema` CLI or the curation process. Examples include:
  * Adding metadata fields
  * Updating pinned ontologies or gene references
  * Changing the validation requirements for a metadata field
  
**Patch version** is incremented for editorial updates to the schema.

All changes are documented in the schema [Changelog](#appendix-a-changelog).


## Background

CELLxGENE aims to support the publication, sharing, and exploration of single-cell datasets. Building on those published datasets, CELLxGENE seeks to create references of the phenotypes and composition of cells that make up human tissues.

Creating references from multiple datasets requires some harmonization of metadata and features, but if that harmonization is too onerous, it will burden the goal of rapid data sharing. CELLxGENE balances publishing and reference creation needs by requiring datasets hosted by CELLxGENE Discover to include a small set of metadata readily available from data submitters.

This document describes the schema, a type of contract, that CELLxGENE requires all datasets to adhere to so that it can enable searching, filtering, and integration of datasets it hosts.

Note that the requirements in the schema are just the minimum required information. Datasets often have additional metadata, which is preserved in datasets submitted to CELLxGENE Discover.

## Overview

This schema supports multiple assay types. Each assay takes the form of one or more two-dimensional matrices whose values are quantitative measures of the phenotypes of cells.

The schema additionally describes how the dataset, genes, and cells are annotated to describe the biological and technical characteristics of the data.

This document is organized by:

* [General requirements](#general-requirements)
* [`X` (Matrix layers)](#x-matrix-layers), which describe the data required for different assays
* [`obs` (Cell metadata)](#obs-cell-metadata), which describe each cell in the dataset
* [`obsm` (Embeddings)](#obsm-embeddings), which describe each embedding in the dataset
* [`obsp`](#obsp), which describe pairwise annotation of observations
* [`var` and `raw.var` (Gene metadata)](#var-and-rawvar-gene-metadata), which describe each gene in the dataset
* [`varm`](#varm), which describe multi-dimensional annotation of variables/features
* [`varp`](#varp), which describe pairwise annotation of variables/features
* [`uns` (Dataset metadata)](#uns-dataset-metadata), which describe the dataset as a whole

## General Requirements

**AnnData.** The canonical data format for CELLxGENE Discover is HDF5-backed [AnnData](https://anndata.readthedocs.io/en/latest) as written by AnnData version 0.8.0 or greater. The on-disk format must be [AnnData specification (v0.1.0)](https://anndata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fileformat-prose.html#anndata-specification-v0-1-0). Part of the rationale for selecting this format is to allow CELLxGENE to access both the data and metadata within a single file. The schema requirements and definitions for the AnnData `X`, `obs`, `var`, `raw.var`, `obsm`, and `uns` attributes are described below.

**Organisms**. Data MUST be from a Metazoan organism or SARS-COV-2 and defined in the NCBI organismal classification. For data that is neither Human, Mouse, nor SARS-COV-2, features MUST be translated into orthologous genes from the pinned Human and Mouse gene annotations.

**Reserved Names**. The names of metadata fields MUST NOT start with `"__"`. The names of the metadata fields specified by the schema are **reserved** for the purposes and specifications described in the schema.

**Unique Names**. The names of schema and data submitter metadata fields in `obs` and `var` MUST be unique. For example, duplicate `"feature_biotype"` keys in AnnData `var` are not allowed.

Reserved Names from previous schema versions that have since been deprecated MUST NOT be present in datasets:

**Redundant Metadata**. It is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to avoid multiple metadata fields containing identical or similar information.

**No Personal Identifiable Information (PII)**.  This is not strictly enforced by validation because it is difficult for software to predict what is and is not PII; however, curators MUST agree to the data submission policies of CELLxGENE Discover on behalf of data submitters which includes this requirement:

> It is my responsibility to ensure that this data is not identifiable. In particular, I commit that I will remove any [direct personal identifiers](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sboOmbafvMh3VYjK1-3MAUt0I13UUJfkQseq8ANLPl8/edit) in the metadata portions of the data, and that CZI may further contact me if it believes more work is needed to de-identify it.

This includes names, emails, or other PII for researchers or curators involved in the data generation and submission.

#### *Note on types*
The types below are python3 types. Note that a python3 `str` is a sequence of Unicode code points, which is stored null-terminated and UTF-8-encoded by AnnData.

## `X` (Matrix Layers)

The data stored in the `X` data matrix is the data that is viewable in CELLxGENE Explorer. CELLxGENE does not impose any additional constraints on the `X` data matrix.

In any layer, if a matrix has 50% or more values that are zeros, it is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED that the matrix be encoded as a [`scipy.sparse.csr_matrix`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.csr_matrix.html) with zero values encoded as <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/tutorial/sparse.html#sparse-arrays-implicit-zeros-and-duplicates">implicit zeros</a>.

CELLxGENE's matrix layer requirements are tailored to optimize data reuse. Because each assay has different characteristics, the requirements differ by assay type. In general, CELLxGENE requires submission of "raw" data suitable for computational reuse when a standard raw matrix format exists for an assay. It is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to also include a "normalized" matrix with processed values ready for data analysis and suitable for visualization in CELLxGENE Explorer. So that CELLxGENE's data can be provided in download formats suitable for both R and Python, the schema imposes the following requirements:

*   All matrix layers MUST have the same shape, and have the same cell labels and gene labels.
*   Because it is impractical to retain all barcodes in raw and normalized matrices, any cell filtering MUST be applied to both.
    By contrast, those wishing to reuse datasets require access to raw gene expression values, so genes SHOULD NOT be filtered from either dataset.
    Summarizing, any cell barcodes that are removed from the data MUST be filtered from both raw and normalized matrices and genes SHOULD NOT be filtered from the raw matrix.
*   Any genes that publishers wish to filter from the normalized matrix MAY have their values replaced by zeros and MUST be flagged in the column [`feature_is_filtered`](#feature_is_filtered) of [`var`](#var-and-rawvar-gene-metadata), which will mask them from exploration.
*   Additional layers provided at author discretion MAY be stored using author-selected keys, but MUST have the same cells and genes as other layers. It is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED that these layers have names that accurately summarize what the numbers in the layer represent (e.g. `"counts_per_million"`, `"SCTransform_normalized"`, or `"RNA_velocity_unspliced"`).

The following table describes the matrix data and layers requirements that are **assay-specific**. If an entry in the table is empty, the schema does not have any other requirements on data in those layers beyond the ones listed above.

| Assay | "raw" required? | "raw" location | "normalized" required? | "normalized" location |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| scRNA-seq (UMI, e.g. 10x v3, Slide-seqV2) | REQUIRED. Values MUST be de-duplicated molecule counts. Each cell MUST contain at least one non-zero value. All non-zero values MUST be positive integers stored as `numpy.float32`.| `AnnData.raw.X` unless no "normalized" is provided, then `AnnData.X` | STRONGLY RECOMMENDED | `AnnData.X` |
| Descendant of Visium Spatial Gene Expression | REQUIRED. Values MUST be de-duplicated molecule counts. All non-zero values MUST be positive integers stored as `numpy.float32`.<br><br>If <code>uns['spatial']['is_single']</code> is <code>False</code> then each cell MUST contain at least one non-zero value.<br><br>If <code>uns['spatial']['is_single']</code> is <code>True</code> then the unfiltered feature-barcode matrix (<code>raw_feature_bc_matrix</code>) MUST be used. See <a href="https://www.10xgenomics.com/support/software/space-ranger/analysis/outputs/space-ranger-feature-barcode-matrices">Space Ranger Feature-Barcode Matrices</a>.<br><br>if <code>assay_ontology_term_id</code> is <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/efo/classes?obo_id=EFO%3A0022860"><code>"EFO:0022860"</code></a> for <i>Visium CytAssist Spatial Gene Expression, 11mm</i>, this matrix MUST contain 14336 rows; otherwise, this matrix MUST contain 4992 rows.<br><br>If the <code>obs['in_tissue']</code> value is <code>1</code>, then the cell MUST contain at least one non-zero value. If any <code>obs['in_tissue']</code> values are <code>0</code>, then at least one cell corresponding to a <code>obs['in_tissue']</code> with a value of <code>0</code> MUST contain a non-zero value.| `AnnData.raw.X` unless no "normalized" is provided, then `AnnData.X` | STRONGLY RECOMMENDED | `AnnData.X` |
| scRNA-seq (non-UMI, e.g. SS2) | REQUIRED. Values MUST be one of read counts (e.g. FeatureCounts) or  estimated fragments (e.g. output of RSEM). Each cell MUST contain at least one non-zero value. All non-zero values MUST be positive integers stored as `numpy.float32`. | `AnnData.raw.X` unless no "normalized" is provided, then `AnnData.X` | STRONGLY RECOMMENDED | `AnnData.X` |
| Accessibility (e.g. ATAC-seq, mC-seq) | NOT REQUIRED | | REQUIRED | `AnnData.X` | STRONGLY RECOMMENDED |
|||||

## Integration Metadata

CELLxGENE requires ontology terms to enable search, comparison, and integration of data.
Ontology terms for cell metadata MUST use [OBO-format identifiers](http://www.obofoundry.org/id-policy.html), meaning a CURIE (prefixed identifier) of the form **Ontology:Identifier**.
For example, [EFO:0000001](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/efo/classes?obo_id=EFO%3A0000001) is a term in the Experimental Factor Ontology (EFO).

The most accurate ontology term MUST always be used. If an exact or approximate ontology term is not available, a new term may be requested:

- For the [Cell Ontology], data submitters may [suggest a new term](https://github.com/obophenotype/cell-ontology/issues/new?assignees=bvarner-ebi&labels=new+term+request%2C+cellxgene&template=a_adding_term_cellxgene.md&title=%5BNTR-cxg%5D) and [notify the curation team](mailto:cellxgene@chanzuckerberg.com) of the pending term request, so that the datasets can be updated once the term is available.

  To meet CELLxGENE schema requirements, the most accurate available CL term MUST be used until the new term is available. For example if `cell_type_ontology_term_id` describes a relay interneuron, but the most accurate available term in the CL ontology is [CL:0000099](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/cl/classes?obo_id=CL%3A0000099) for *interneuron*, then the interneuron term can be used to fulfill this requirement and ensures that users searching for "neuron" are able to find these data.  If no appropriate term can be found (e.g. the cell type is unknown), then `"unknown"` MUST be used. Users will still be able to access more specific cell type annotations that have been submitted with the dataset (but aren't required by the schema).

   
- For all other ontologies, data submitters may submit a [request to the curation team](mailto:cellxgene@chanzuckerberg.com) during the submission process.

Terms documented as obsolete in an ontology MUST NOT be used. For example, [EFO:0009310](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/efo/classes/http%253A%252F%252Fwww.ebi.ac.uk%252Fefo%252FEFO_0009310) for *obsolete_10x v2* was marked as obsolete in EFO version 3.31.0 and replaced by [EFO:0009899](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/efo/classes?obo_id=EFO%3A0009899) for *10x 3' v2*.

### Required Gene Annotations

ENSEMBL identifiers are required for genes and [External RNA Controls Consortium (ERCC)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4978944/) identifiers for [RNA Spike-In Control Mixes] to ensure that all datasets measure the same features and can therefore be integrated.

The following gene annotation dependencies are *pinned* for this version of the schema. For multi-organism experiments, cells from any Metazoan organism are allowed as long as orthologs from the following organism annotations are used.
